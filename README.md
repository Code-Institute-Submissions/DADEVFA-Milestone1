## About

This website is created to be a blend of the traditional artist/band website, and a
linktree platform that will send the artists fans and listeners to the streaming service 
they currently use. Alot of musicans outsource this link functionality outside their
sites, which is a bad way of building or maintaining their brands, and it makes 
the road for the listener/users a bit longer, since they now have to click more, and wait for a another, 
less beautiful site to load, before being able to choose prefered streaming service.

# UX - User Experiece:

## As a new visitor who comes straight from any social media profile of the artist and has not heard any music yet:

1. I want to know how I can quickly go to whats most important, the music. 

2. I want to understand the layout and reason for the sites functions without having to focus too much.

3. I want to be able hear a sample of any song before I commit to move my attention to another platform to stream the full song, where I most likely will find even more of the artist.

## As a visitor who comes straight from a campaign for a specific song: 

1. I want to be able to see that I landed on the right place, that specific songs page.

2. I want to understand the layout and reason for the sites functions without having to focus too much.

3. I want to be able to find my streaming platform, to play the song from there. 

## As a visitor who really likes the artist: 

1. I want to be able to connect with the artist. 

2. I want to be able to read something about the artist. 

3. I would like to be able to get a notification from the artist when there is something new going on. 


# Design 

Because it's an artist website, the design had to be slightly personal for the artist. 
Main goal for the look and feeling of the website, was to be easy, light yet special and most of all, 
something that wouldn't feel like a corporate website.

## Fonts: 

For the text that mentions artist name:
```
* Main font: Americana STD 

* Pre fallback font: Lateef (Google Fonts)

* Fallback font: Serif
```

For all other text:
```
* Main font: Lao 

* Pre fallback font: Baskervville (Google Fonts)

* Fallback font: Sans-serif
```

## Colors:

## Mockups / Design

Layout and design was made and created in Adobe Xd. 
The pictures above are the first draft design. I would say the live website and the 
design drafted are pretty similar.
